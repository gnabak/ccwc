# ccwc
The ccwc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output. A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a ⟨newline⟩ character. Characters beyond the final ⟨newline⟩ character will not be included in the line count.
